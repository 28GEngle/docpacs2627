/*
1: Open the appDb connection ^
2: Ensure a table called "migration-tracking" exists in app.db ^
3: Use fs module to read the "migrations" folder ^
4: Sort the contents of the "migrations" folder by name (001 first, 002 second, etc) ^
5: Retrieve the names of the completed migrations from app.db ^
6: Identify which migrations still need to be done based on what is in app.db ^
7: Run each of the migrations in order ^
8: Record successful migrations ^
9: Report what was changed/applied ^
10: Close database cleanly via appDb.close() ^
